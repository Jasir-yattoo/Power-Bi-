# Power-Bi
## End-to-end Power BI project for sales analysis

We first did the ETL(extract, transform, and load) in this project. Using the Power Query We Cleaned the Data
We removed all the null Values and all the errors in the dataset.

Once the date was cleaned we loaded the data and created the dashboard using various visuals available in the
Power Bi.

We created a Dashboard from our cleaned data using various Visuals like Bar charts, Donut charts, and Pie charts.

We drew various insights from the data like the city which had the most sales were California and phones were
the highest sold subcategory.
